    Types that implement copy
    - All the integer types, such as u32.
    - The Boolean type, bool, with values true and false.
    - All the floating-point types, such as f64.
    - The character type, char.
    - Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement Copy. For example, (i32, i32) implements Copy, but (i32, String) does not.
